                        today the date is monday, july 8th. im writing this from a hotel just outside the kyoto rail station, in what will be the first entry in this website.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        again i find myself falling into a pit of loneliness, at no fault other than my own. this city doesn't have enough to distract me.
                        recently i've walked so much every day that i can't stay up for long enough to contemplate.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        so i write myself another website. new. better. twenty twenty four.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        im not fucked up like i was a long time ago. but i did some bad things which i don't think i've quite made up for.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        for a while i missed her, and i still do. she was perfect in every way. but not for me.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        i hope she doesn't think too poorly of me. i didn't lie. i will always love her.<br/>
                        i hope she doesn't think my final message to her is stupid.<br/>
                        i don't want us to be together again or anything like that.<br/>
                        but i hope i can talk to her again one more time a long time from now.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        when i prayed and received my fortune from the temple, i was told that whoever i was looking for would not come. and
                        bad fortune would befall me in the time to come, as it always had. i know what the universe was telling me, and i knew it was true.
                        i wished for the same you see me wish now.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        the future stares back at me with gleaming malice.<br/>
                        <br/>

                        morn of july 9th, kyoto (not the first time i've thought this but the day which i chose to write about it):<br/>
                        <br/>
                        something she kept repeating over and over and over in the last month or two we were together was how she was "so grateful that her parents exposed her to a wide variety of foods at a young age" so she could enjoy all the foods she finds yummy now.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        this was in response to the fact that *i* don't really like eating out at restaurants or trying new foods or really eating at all that much... which is fine to bring up of course but she NEVER stopped bringing it up. like ANY time she would be eating something herself
                        she be like hm.. "im so grateful my parents ..."<br/>
                        <br/>
                        it's one of those things which in the moment are whatever - like i wasn't really annoyed or anything but i definitely noticed how much she brought it up
                        and after a while it was just like "yes babe" "ur so right babe" "yes my angel" and she would make this matter-of-fact face when i agreed with her.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        but i guess in hindsight it was kind of cute.<br/>
                        <br/>
